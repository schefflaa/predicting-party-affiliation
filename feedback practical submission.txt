this is the feedback for your third portfolio. Your final
grade will be available in Portal2 soon.

You received a green for your practical submission.
Overall, it is a very good submission. The discussion of the
results could have been a bit more extensive, though I like
your analysis of the confusion matrices. At times, the
notebook reads rather documentary. Including the figures as
pictures somewhat undermines the point of the notebook and
results in me seeing each result table twice.


Best regards,
Lea and Jonathan
